To login to the main machine:
ssh mansurm@aadpoola.informatik.uni-freiburg.de


To login to a meta machine:
ssh metasub3

It is always better to connect to metasub3 because it have internet access.
From a meta machine you submit jobs to the meta core with the help of qsub.
jobs are prioritized autmatically

Command to check the status of jobs at meta core:
qstat -q meta_core.q -f


Command to do something else:
qstat -f

Connect to the test_core: (You can test your scripts from here but don#t run the commands that are too long):
qlogin -q test_core.q


---------------------------------------
How does it work ----------------------
---------------------------------------

You make the virtual environment in the startup script
then it think you just send another script which contains how many times you want to run the python script
but will the virtual environment activated in one script, still be working when the other script is running ?
